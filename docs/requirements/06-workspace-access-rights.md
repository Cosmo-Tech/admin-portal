I want to be able to add or remove access rights for users on the different resources of the platform, such as organizations, solutions, workspaces.

This is the most used flow:
1. go to the workspace and define a user as "Editor". This automatically sets the user as "Editor" for the parent "Solution" and "Organization".

2. go to the workspace and define a user as "Viewer". This automatically sets the user as "Viewer" for the parent "Solution" and "Organization".

3. go to the workspace and see the list of users with access to the workspace, and their access rights.
